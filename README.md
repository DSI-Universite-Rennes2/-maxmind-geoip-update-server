[![License: EUPL 1.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eClip-/EUPL-badge/master/eupl_1.2.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

This project goal is to permit easy local redistribution of Maxmind's GeoIP local databases with the same path and protocol as `updates.maxmind.com`

So you can use Maxmind's GeoIP updaters like our [maxmind-geoip-client-update]() by changing host configuration from `updates.maxmind.com` to your own.

[Maxmind rate limits](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408216129947-Download-and-Update-Databases) :
> Every account is limited to 2,000 total direct downloads in a 24 hour period. If you have to distribute your databases across multiple servers, it is advisable that you download databases to a local repository on your network, and distribute them to other servers from there.

## Features

- All https://updates.maxmind.com/geoip/databases/%s/update endpoint features (HEAD, GET, md5sum etc.)

- You can filter per client IP (CIDR) authorization instead of user/pass,

## Requirements

- max_memory ~ 150M 

## Install

- Install external dependencies : `composer install`
- Configure your web server 
    - to make `/geoip/databases/` path point into the `web-public` directory
